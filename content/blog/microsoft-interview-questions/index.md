Note: Following list was prepared by going through various articles and blog posts

- [Two Sum](/two-sum/)

- [Set Matrix Zeros (TBD)]()

- [Add two integers](/add-two-numbers/)

- [Copy linked list with arbitrary pointer (TBD)]()
You are given a linked list where the node has two pointers. The first is the regular ‘next’ pointer. The second pointer is called ‘arbitrary_pointer’ and it can point to any node in the linked list.
Your job is to write code to make a deep copy of the given linked list. Here, deep copy means that any operations on the original list (inserting, modifying and removing) should not affect the copied list.

- [Given a binary tree, perform a zigzag level order traversal](/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/)

- [Perform a level order traversal of a binary tree](/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/)

- [Reverse words in a sentence (TBD)]()
Reverse the order of words in a given sentence(an array of characters).

- [pPalindromic Substrings(TBD)]()

- [Find maximum single sell profit (TBD)]()
Given a list of daily stock prices (integers for simplicity), return the buy and sell prices for making the maximum profit. You need to maximize the single buy/sell profit. If you can't make any profit, try to minimize the loss.

- [Find the missing number in the array (TBD)]()
You are given an array of positive numbers from 1 to n, such that all numbers from 1 to n are present except one number 'x'. We have to find 'x'. The input array is not sorted.

- [Find all sum combinations (TBD)]()
Given a positive integer, target, print all possible combinations of positive integers that sum up to the target number.

- [Regular expression matching (TBD)]()
Given a text and a pattern, determine if the pattern matches with the text completely or not at all by using regular expression matching. For simplicity, assume that the pattern may contain only two operators: '.' and '*'. Operator '*' in the pattern means that the character preceding '*' may not appear or may appear any number of times in the text. Operator '.' matches with any character in the text exactly once.

- [Clone a directed graph (TBD)]()
Given the root node of a directed graph, clone this graph by creating its deep copy so that the cloned graph has the same vertices and edges as the original graph.

- [Find the median of the sliding window (TBD)]()
Given an array of numbers and a number ‘k’, find the median of all the ‘k’ sized sub-arrays (or windows) of the array.

- [Search for the given key in a 2d matrix (TBD)]()
We are given a 2D array where all elements in any individual row or column are sorted. In such a matrix, we have to search or find the position of a given key.
